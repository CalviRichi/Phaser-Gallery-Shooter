Welcome to GALAXIGAIAN ... (by Calvin Richards)

This is a gallery shooter very much inspired by Galaxian and Galaga (hence the name, I apologize for lack of creativity).
The controls consist of "A" to move left, "D" to move right, "B" to shoot bullets, and "M" to shoot missiles. 
Additionally in the title screen you press "SPACE" to select your ship / difficulty.

The game has 4 enemy types with 2 movement patterns. There is a difficulty that is decided by player stats, which are chosen
in the title screen. In addition to the enemies there are meteors which upon contact with the ship will explode and do damage. 
I did not have enough time to add sound or sprite animations, but there are animations for when collisions occur.

The game follows all of the main requirements that are laid out, in addition to that, it has a title screen that doubles as 
a controls screen (some of the controls are shown on the next screen). There are not distinct levels but there are distinct enemy waves and difficulties that you could play at. 

The scoring has not been altered, it is just based on enemies destroyed, additionally meteors count for more points.
